But looking for support shouldn't be your goal. Your life accomplishments come from your hard work, and if your focus is working to impress other people, they dictate your happiness and your life's direction. Esteem is desirable, but only to a limit. Be good enough for yourself and make self-esteem the foundation for your drive and passion.",
